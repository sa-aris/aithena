## [2.0.0] — Unreleased

### Added
- Decision boundaries with named constraints, weighted proposals, explainable rejections, and independent per-cause random draws.
- Social contracts separating personal knowledge, private intentions, sustained work, outcome evidence, and individual judgments. Includes resource reservations, local gossip, confidence and source paths, evidence corrections, and bounded state.
- Opt-in `GameWorld` and `SimulationManager` integration with movement, stamina, urgent needs, memories, and typed social events.
- Versioned social snapshots with exact 64-bit identifiers, pending work and reservations, and atomic validation before replacing state.
- Social demonstration, focused regression suites, and a population benchmark.
- A 4K animated preview recorded from the native social scenario, English character names, and revised integration documentation.

### Fixed
- Negative spatial coordinates no longer invoke undefined behavior when constructing cell keys.
- JSON numbers preserve double precision; nonfinite values serialize as `null`, and mutable array access checks its bounds.
- Simulation manager API mismatches, day-wrapping event timestamps, zero LOD intervals, duplicate spawns, and skill/weather subscription lifetimes.
- The C API version string now matches the CMake project version. Shared-library version and soname metadata are set from the project version.

### Changed
- **Breaking:** `GameWorld` has a stable address: copying and moving are disabled because its subscriptions and perception hooks reference the world. Move a `std::unique_ptr<GameWorld>` when transferring ownership.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-07-09

### Added

**Living World update — six new systems**
- Reputation & Crime system (`social/reputation_system.hpp`) — witnessed crimes damage community reputation, unwitnessed crimes become unsolved cases, serious crimes post gold bounties, guards act on outlaws; per-witness hook for gossip/memory integration
- Dynamic economy (`economy/economy_system.hpp`) — settlement-level production chains, per-capita consumption, `(target/stock)^elasticity` price curves, and caravans that auto-arbitrage price gaps between settlements
- Procedural quest generator (`quest/quest_generator.hpp`) — turns live world state into ready-to-register quests: bounty hunts from unsolved crimes, supply runs from shortages, mediations from feuds, gift deliveries from friendships, caravan escorts; situation fingerprinting prevents duplicates
- Family & lifecycle system (`social/family_system.hpp`) — households, marriage with kinship and relationship gates, children, four life stages, age-ramped mortality, and estate inheritance; all transitions emit drainable `LifecycleEvent`s
- Sound perception (`perception/sound_perception.hpp`) — discrete noise events attenuated by distance and walls, degraded position estimates for faint sounds, urgency-ranked investigation targets, `SensoryInput` bridge into `PerceptionSystem`
- World save/load (`serialization/save_load.hpp`) — `WorldSaveGame` bundles relationships (with event history), reputation & crimes, economy, and families into one versioned JSON file with custom section hooks

**Demos & tests**
- Village simulation now runs the living-world systems: a working village economy with caravans, a crime-and-bounty storyline, a soundscape that reacts to the wolf attack, a procedurally filled quest board, and a save/load roundtrip verification
- Browser demo (WASM) gained reputation/crime and quest-board log events with new `crime` and `quest` log tags
- 51 new unit tests (137 total) covering all six systems plus cross-system integration

### Changed
- Completed the project-wide rename to **Aithena** — demo page title, console banners, benchmark output, CI summary, and source file headers now all use the new name
- Live demo links now point to the renamed GitHub Pages URL (`sa-aris.github.io/aithena`)

### Fixed
- `serialization/json.hpp` now includes `<cstdint>` — it previously failed to compile when included before any header that pulled in the fixed-width integer types

## [1.0.0] — 2026-03-10

### Added

**Core AI systems**
- Finite State Machine (FSM) with guarded transitions, priority ordering, blackboard integration, and transition history
- Behavior Tree with composite/decorator/leaf nodes, fluent builder API, `ServiceNode`, `TimeoutDecorator`, `RetryDecorator`, `RandomSelectorNode`, and `debugSnapshot()`
- Utility AI with linear, sigmoid, exponential, and bell-curve response curves
- GOAP (Goal-Oriented Action Planning) with A* over world-state space

**Perception & Memory**
- Sight cone (configurable angle + range), hearing radius, line-of-sight via Bresenham
- Episodic memory with emotional impact scores, importance weights, and three decay stages: Fading / Nearly Forgotten / Forgotten
- Gossip propagation with trust-based reliability degradation and per-hop decay

**Emotion & Needs**
- Seven emotion types (Happy, Sad, Angry, Fearful, Disgusted, Surprised, Neutral) with intensity, duration, and decay
- Seven need types (Hunger, Thirst, Sleep, Social, Fun, Safety, Comfort) with configurable decay rates
- Emotional contagion — nearby NPCs share emotional states scaled by empathy and proximity

**Navigation**
- A* pathfinding with node budget, tie-break weighting, 8-directional movement, partial path fallback, and LRU path cache
- `NavRegions` flood-fill connectivity map for O(1) reachability pre-checks
- Dynamic obstacle invalidation, Catmull-Rom path smoothing
- `WaypointGraph` for sparse navigation over large open worlds
- `PathRequestQueue` for async, budget-limited batched pathfinding
- Steering behaviours: seek, flee, wander, arrival, obstacle avoidance, separation, cohesion, alignment

**Social & Faction**
- Faction system with six stance types (Peace, Alliance, War, Trade, Vassal, Truce), cascade war declarations, and coalition resolution
- Relationship system — directed graph with per-event history, trust channel, time-based decay, and narrative recall
- Social influence chains — hop-by-hop belief/rumour propagation with reliability degradation and charge mutation
- Group behavior with formation system (line, wedge, circle, column) and tactical roles

**World infrastructure**
- Typed event bus with priority ordering, delayed dispatch, event chains, filter predicates, and RAII subscription lifetime
- Shared blackboard with TTL expiry, version counters, and prefix-scoped watcher callbacks
- Two-layer spatial index: `SpatialGrid` (uniform hash-grid) + `QuadTree` (adaptive), with unified `SpatialIndex` façade
- LOD system — three tiers (Active / Background / Dormant), hysteresis, importance scoring, velocity prediction, per-frame CPU budget tracking
- `SimulationManager` orchestrating the full update pipeline
- Zero-dependency JSON serializer and NPC state serializer

**Combat, Trade, Schedule, Dialogue, Quest, Skills**
- Combat: threat assessment, ability system, stamina/mana pools, damage type resistances, flee thresholds
- Trade: supply/demand pricing, personality-based markup, relationship discounts
- Schedule: time-of-day activity planner with need and event overrides
- Dialogue: branching trees, reputation-based text variants, event-bus side effects
- Quest: assignment, progress tracking, completion/failure events
- Skills: six domains, XP, level thresholds, perk unlocks, stat bonuses

**Scripting & Bindings**
- Lua 5.4 scripting bridge — define full NPC FSM behaviour in Lua with no C++ changes
- Pure-C API (`npc_capi.h`) for Unity (P/Invoke), Unreal (native plugin), and Godot (GDExtension)
- WebAssembly build via Emscripten with live browser demo on GitHub Pages

**Tooling**
- CMake 3.16+ build system with optional targets: `npc_lua`, `npc_shared`, `npc_wasm`, `run_benchmarks`
- Performance benchmark suite covering full tick, emotion, FSM, pathfinding, spatial index, relationships, memory, and footprint
- CI matrix: GCC 12, Clang 15, macOS (Apple Clang) — builds, tests, and benchmarks on every push
- ~75 unit tests via zero-dependency test framework
